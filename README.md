# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

The Twitter Sentiment Analysis, which many of us think it's just an application of NLP-Natural Language Processing but it's not only involues NLP, I'm saying this beecause before doing dig up about this topic I was in a mindset that it can be done only with NLP.

The sentiment analysis involues ML-Machine Learning, DL-Deep Learning and yes it involues NLP.

Our first duty is to process the text data, which is raw data and unstructed one. After we process it and we remove the unwanted informations from the text data
we proceed to modeling the algorithm.

Here in this project I've used only,
             		Logistic Regression
              Support Vector Machine
            XGBoost(without tuning)
						
But we can use many algorithms for modeling the classification, but for comparing reasons I've selected these three.

Anyways we all know that in XGBoost we will get a good F1 Score than any of the other two.
